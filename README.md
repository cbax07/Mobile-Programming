**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
This application will be used to track items in a warehouse. This application must include the following elements: A database with at least two tables, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords. A screen for logging into the app. Note that this should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before. A screen, with a grid, that displays all items in the inventory. A mechanism by which the user can add and remove items from inventory. A mechanism by which the user can increase or decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory. A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to 0 (zero).

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**
Coding a mobile application is different than coding a software program in java. I had to keep in mind how to properly display the UI as well as implementing the UX. Keeping organized and working on each feature of the program seperately was a good way to progress through the coding. I have learned a lot during this project and will implement many of the lessons for my next project.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**
Testing my code was simple with the Andriod emulator. Running the application and testing each feature and screen transition was simple and easy.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
During the design of this application, there were many times I was faced with a challenge. One example was when I was implementing the login feature using a NoSQL database. By spending some time researching the different functions and their outputs, I was able to figure out my mistakes and correct the problem. Thankfully there is a wealth of information online to help with nearly every coding problem and by spending some time looking into these issues, nearly any problem can be solved.
